<h1 align="center"> The future of grocery shopping: a look into grocery delivery script </h1>

The traditional grocery shopping experience typically involved visiting a physical store location, pushing a cart or carrying a handheld basket through the aisles, and selecting desired items off the shelves to place in the cart. Shoppers would browse through the various departments like produce, meat, dairy, dry goods, and frozen foods to find the necessary items on their list. Checkout lines formed at staffed cash registers where items were scanned, bagged, and paid for, often requiring cash, check, or credit/debit card transactions. 

This in-person approach allowed shoppers to physically inspect items before purchasing, but also required transportation to and from the store along with the time spent traveling through aisles and waiting in lines.
